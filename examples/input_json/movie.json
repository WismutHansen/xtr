  "summary": "Reviewers say 'The Dark Knight' is celebrated for its intricate plot, stellar performances, and profound themes. Heath Ledger's Joker is often hailed as a career-defining role, overshadowing Christian Bale's Batman. The film's examination of morality and heroism is widely praised. Christopher Nolan's direction and Hans Zimmer's score enhance the experience. However, some criticize the pacing and character arcs. Despite this, it remains a pivotal film in the superhero genre.",
